I want to create a Real-Time Fuel Pump Finder Android App.

In First Activity, I want to show:

A Google Map displaying only nearby petrol pumps â›½ based on the userâ€™s current location.

Two buttons: Login and Signup.

The map and nearby pump markers should be visible to all users even without logging in.

After Login/Signup, the user will get additional features:

When the user clicks on any petrol pump marker, a popup window will appear.

The popup will show:

Availability of Petrol, Diesel, CNG

Quantity in liters or availability status (e.g., "Low", "Full")

Live traffic ðŸš¦ status around the pump using Google Traffic Layer

Please include:

Firebase Authentication for login/signup

Google Maps API integration for real-time maps and traffic

Geolocation to detect user's current location

A way to store and fetch fuel data from Firebase Firestore (or Realtime Database)

Show only pumps within a 5 km radius

Use MVVM architecture

Clean UI with Material Design

Additional:

Show a toast if location is disabled

Give real-time updates if a pumpâ€™s availability changes

Separate Admin Panel (optional) for updating pump fuel status

I want the code to be written in Java or Kotlin, and compatible with the latest Android version.
